# shell-operating system

Prompt the user and read the commands and send them to the operating system for execution.

The screen has a scheduler information that signals the process that runs it, that is, a scheduler information message
The son process [[as we saw in the lesson (18:00 + -)]]. This information is in the proc / PID / sched / file,
When the PID is the PID of the son process. The printing of the information can be done by the cat command or any other way.
